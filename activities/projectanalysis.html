		<h1>Truffles and Trifles. Website Re-Design</h1>
		<h4>Designer: Linda Kounechongprasert</h4>
		
	<article id="intent">
	<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>	For this re-design project, the intent will be to create a more appealing and uniform UI.  The focus will be placed on reorganizing page layout as well as choosing fonts and colors for the site that will compliment each other and make for a better user experience. The goal is to get more users to visit the site and browse. This will give them a chance to see what the company has to offer and lead them to possibly book a cooking class or purchase a gift basket.</p>
		<p>Another focus of the re-design will be to condense the site and remove some of the unneccessary pages. The completed site will consist of 6 well organized and informative pages. The layout will be designed to make browsing the site easier and inviting. The main navigation will be placed in a more accessible place on the page and a call to action will be created for the home page, inviting users to book a cooking class.</p>
