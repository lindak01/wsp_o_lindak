		<h3>Cooking Classes Make A Great Gift!</h3>
			<p>Gift certificates are the perfect gift for everyone. A certificate costs $54.00 and allows the student to attend any class except for special wine dinners.  Certificates are valid for 6 months from the time of purchase. A perfect gift for any occasion.
When purchasing a gift certificate, if mailed it will come in an envelope. If you pick up in person, we will put in a box with a pretty bow. Web site is listed on gift certificate to allow those who receive gift certificates to check which classes they would be interested in taking. We do not print out schedules with gift certificates because we sell classes out so quickly that they become obsolete almost immediately.</p>

		<h3>Group Events</h3>
			<p>Looking for a fun evening, morning, or afternoon?   Bring your group to Truffles and Trifles for a cooking class.   Whether for a brunch class, a luncheon, or an evening party, we can help you entertain your clients, have a spouse program, or just have a fun time with friends and family.  We can guarantee a unique and special time.   We specialize in Business Team Building events and have had groups ranging from the Orlando Sentinel Editors to Charles Schwab to Disney Directors and spouse groups of every variety you can imagine.  We meet with you and discuss a menu that will compliment your group and what they will want to learn. Each attendee will get a booklet with tips and recipes. We can have up to 50 people for hands on or up to 65 for a demonstration in our shop. Off premise classes are also available. In addition to our classes we can do amenities for conventions as well as gift baskets. We also do children's parties. We meet with the child and they pick out their favorite menu - including - homemade birthday cake and homemade ice cream. All private parties have a 16-person minimum, including children. Head count of attendees is due 4 days prior to party with balance of monies also due at that time. Cancellation of private parties will be a loss of deposit. If you move your date prior to 4 weeks of your party there will be no penalty.  Click Here for Latest Class Schedules
If you just want to attend a regular cooking class (see schedule below) held during the week, just call.  You do not need a group.  Individuals may sign up for any regularly scheduled class.  The minimum number of 16 is only required for a private class.</p>

		<h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
			<p>There is a 72 HOUR Cancellation Policy**</p>

			<p>If you cancel 72 hours prior to the class you will either be given a credit for another class or receive your money back. However if you cancel within the one week there will be no refund. We wish it could be otherwise, but by that time all of the foods and recipes are bought and written. We will send you copies of the recipes upon your request if you are unable to attend and cancel within the 72 hour framework. This also holds true for gift certificates. When you register for a class, and you have a gift certificate, we request that you mail it to us within 72 hours of registering.</p>

			<p>If you register more than two people and cancel within two weeks of class, you  will be charged for those people. We cannot lose that many people, because we then lose and entire team and 2-3 recipes for that class. Please respect this requirement.
If you are registering for your friends, it would be best to have each register separately. Then if anything comes up, you would not be responsible.</p>


			<p>** The exception to this rule is DATE NIGHT AND TECHNIQUES - FOR DATE NIGHT AND TECHNIQUES THERE IS A FULL TWO WEEK CANCELLATION POLICY.</p>
