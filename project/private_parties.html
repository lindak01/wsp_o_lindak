		<p>We understand that sometimes things happen, but if you cancel a party within a four-week period of that event, you will lose your deposit.  If you change four weeks outside that date, there will be no extra charge.  Please be sure you have enough guests before selection of a date.  We do have groups that do not have enough guests but choose to pay for the minimum 16, and that is fine.</p>
